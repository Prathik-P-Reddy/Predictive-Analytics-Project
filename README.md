# Predictive-Analytics-Project
Predicting the quality of red and white wine based on certain characteristics.

Wine, an alcoholic drink made from fermented grapes, famous for its intoxicating effects and delicacy. The biochemical process that occur during fermentation produce alcohol and substances that enrich the flavor of the wine and determine wine’s quality. It is important for wine producers to classify wine’s quality accurately. Unfortunately, traditional method is quite labor-intensive and time-consuming.


This R machine learning project will explore 11 physicochemical properties of wine. The purpose of this project is to evaluate which of these chemical properties influence the quality of the wines and to find the best approach to predict the quality of wine.

The dataset used is Wine Quality Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository and is related to the white wine variants of the Portuguese Vin ho Verde variety of wine. Due to privacy & logistics issues the dataset only contains 11 physiochemical (input) and 1 sensory (output) variables, with 4898 rows.

Attribute Description

1. fixed acidity:	Acidity is a fundamental property of wine, imparting sourness, and resistance to microbial infection. Fixed acidity is the no. of grams of tartaric acid per dm3
2. volatile acidity:	Wine spoilage is legally defined by volatile acidity which is calculated as no. of grams of acetic acid per dm3 of wine
3. citric acid:	It is the no. of grams of citric acid per dm3 of wine
4. residual sugar:	Sugar remaining after fermentation stops. Given as no. of grams per dm3
5. chlorides:	It is the no. of grams of sodium chloride per dm3 of wine
6. free sulfur dioxide:	It is the no. of grams of free sulfites per dm3 of wine
7. total sulfur dioxide:	It is the no. of grams of total sulfite in per dm3 of wine
8. density:	It gives the density of the wine in grams per cm3
8. pH:	It gives the pH of the wines, used to measure ripeness in relation to acidity
10. sulphates:	It gives the no. of grams of potassium sulphate per dm3 of wine
11. alcohol:	It gives the volume of alcohol in percentage
12. quality bucket: (Target variable)	Here the wine is rated from 1- 10 based on the quality. 1-5: Low Quality, 6-10: High Quality
